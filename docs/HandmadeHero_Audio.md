  Audio ring buffer:

  How we calculate how much bytes we can write to buffer.

                byte to lock = (running sample index * bytes per sample) % audio buffer size

  (1)

          Don't touch. It's playing
          VVVVVVVVVVVVVVVV
  [+++++++--------++++++++--------]
   ^      ^
   |      |> play cursor
   |> write cursor

                byte to write = play cursor - byte to lock

  (2)

   Don't touch. It's playing
   VVVVVVVVVVVVVVV
  [+++++++--------++++++++--------]
   ^              ^
   |              |> write cursor
   |> play cursor

                byte to write = %TODO%

```
